I'm a junior iOS Developer who loves computer graphics, I had experience making iOS apps for several companies
such as New Land Apps, Lyncott, Sports World, but now I want to make my proyects happend so I went back to my 
University, National Autonomous University of Mexico - Faculty of Engineering (UNAM-FI).

I LOVE to program. I think that if I finish soon my University, I'll make a specialized consultant company on 
computer graphics or a small graphic design studio. I also love music, cats, books and I have alot of different 
hobbies such as dancing, jogging, swimming, diving, etc.

I'm currently learning how to model in Blender and I just love it. I can stay hours doing that and not complaining.
So yes, another thing is that I'm currently learning Kotlin for making Android Apps, so to be sure I speak the same 
language to an Android Developer. My idea is to become a Full Stack Developer, but for that, I have a long road ahead.

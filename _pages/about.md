I'm Luis Ochoa, an **iOS Developer/Engineer** who loves computer graphics, I had experience making iOS apps for several companies
such as New Land Apps, Lyncott, etc., but now I went back to college to make my proyects happend, 
National Autonomous University of Mexico - Engineering Faculty@(UNAM-FI) to make the stuff I really want to make 
and start working on my thesis.

I **LOVE** to program. I think that if I finish soon my University, I'll make a specialized consultant company on 
computer graphics or a small graphic design studio. I also love music, cats, books and I have alot of different 
hobbies such as dancing, jogging, swimming, diving, etc.

On **COVID** times I had advanced on my studies, I had struggled with **electric circuits** in the past, but now on my spare time
I had studied hard to pass that last credit (on the last semester) that was an effort to me, because now I don't have to worry about
the blocking of credits that the Faculty has for not passing credits of earlier semesters. So with the universtity online **I have some time**
to spear but I rather spent it on the credits I'm currently on. If I study hard, I will conclude my studies soon and I will have 
time to spear on my dreams or time to be at a good programming job.

I'm currently learning how to model in Blender and I just love it. I can stay hours doing that and without complaining.
Another thing is that I'm currently learning Kotlin for making Android Apps, so to be sure I speak the same language as 
an Android Developer. My idea is to become a **Full Stack Developer**, but for that, I have a long road ahead.

I'm a junior iOS Developer who loves computer graphics, I had experience making iOS apps for several companies
such as GPS Phoenix, Lyncott, Banco Azteca, but now I want to make my proyects happend so I went back to my 
University, my home sweet home, UNAM.

I like to program, I love it. I think that if I finish soon my University, I'll make a specialized consultant  
company on computer graphics or a small graphic design studio. I also like music, cats, I love to read and I 
have alot of different hobbies as dancing, running(jogging), swimming, diving, etc.

I'm currently learning how to model in Blender and I just love it. I can stay hours doing that and not complaining.
So yes, another thing is that I'm currently learning Kotlin for making Android Apps so to be sure I speak the same 
language to an Android Developer. My idea is to become a Full Stack Developer, but for that, I have a long road ahead.

**So** in the following **year** I pretend to finish college. As 
with previous years, I think I have become more fine with college
but I'm on the state to just finish it. I want to get that college 
degree so hard, that I'm willing to be committing for the next year
into only be focused on whatever I'll learn at the university. It's 
just this one year and I will be free to spend my time in another 
ventures.

I also want to spend some time reading books, I love to read and 
with college on my way it seams impossible to do that. I also 
have to turn down a lot of opportunites because of my college degree
and I just want it to travel some time. I don't want to be at Mexico
anymore.

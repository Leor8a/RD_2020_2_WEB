**5G** is the fifth generation wireless technology for **digital 
cellular networks** that began wide deployment in 2019. As 
with previous standards, the covered areas are divided into 
regions called "cells", serviced by individual antennas. 
Virtually every major telecommunication service provider in 
the developed world is deploying antennas or intends to deploy 
them soon. The **frequency spectrum** of 5G is divided into 
millimeter waves, mid-band and low-band. Low-band uses a similar 
frequency range as the predecessor, **4G**.


The **Internet of things** (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing 
devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people 
that are provided with unique **identifiers** (UIDs) and the ability to 
transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or 
human-to-computer interaction. The definition of the Internet of things 
has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time 
analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.

A **Smart city** is an **urban area** that uses different types of electronic 
**Internet of Things** (IoT) sensors to **collect data** and then use insights 
gained from that **data** to manage assets, resources and services efficiently. 
This includes data collected from citizens, devices, and assets that is 
processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation 
systems, power plants, utilities, water supply networks, waste management, 
crime detection, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and 
other community services.

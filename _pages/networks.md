**5G** is the fifth generation wireless technology for **digital 
cellular networks** that began wide deployment in 2019. As 
with previous standards, the covered areas are divided into 
regions called "cells", serviced by individual antennas. 
Virtually every major telecommunication service provider in 
the developed world is deploying antennas or intends to deploy 
them soon. The **frequency spectrum** of 5G is divided into 
millimeter waves, mid-band and low-band. Low-band uses a similar 
frequency range as the predecessor, **4G**.

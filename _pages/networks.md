**5G** is the fifth generation wireless technology for **digital 
cellular networks** that began wide deployment in 2019. As 
with previous standards, the covered areas are divided into 
regions called "cells", serviced by individual antennas. 
Virtually every major telecommunication service provider in 
the developed world is deploying antennas or intends to deploy 
them soon. The **frequency spectrum** of 5G is divided into 
millimeter waves, mid-band and low-band. Low-band uses a similar 
frequency range as the predecessor, **4G**.

The **relevance of 5G** is that it can power technology well beyond what
current mobile technology permits. Thanks to its speed and bandwidth, 
5G promises to make significant improvements in 3D holograms, virtual reality 
and augmented reality, creating opportunities to connect people far beyond 
what current cellular technology allows.

The **Internet of things** (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing 
devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people 
that are provided with unique **identifiers** (UIDs) and the ability to 
transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or 
human-to-computer interaction. The definition of the Internet of things 
has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time 
analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.

**XGS-PON** is an updated standard for **Passive Optical Networks (PON)**
that can support higher speed 10 Gbps symmetrical data transfer and is part
of the family of standards known as Gigabit-capable PON, or G-PON. **G-PON** 
stands for Gigabit PON or 1 Gigabit PON. The **X in XGS** represents the number 10, 
and the letter **S stands for symmetrical**, XGS-PON = 10 Gigabit Symmetrical PON. 
An earlier, non-symmetrical 10 Gigabit PON version (XG-PON) was limited to 2.5 Gbps
in the upstream direction.
